                    <td class="main-body"><b><u>Early child hood:</u></b><br>
                    <p>When I was younger, my childhood wasn't very exciting. When I started school for the first time, I was scared shitless and didn't make any friends, which didn't help my situation. During lunch breaks, I would sit in a corner and eat my lunch alone and couldn't wait for the day to be over. It got worse when I started the second year of school when the bullying started. I was picked on for reasons, I still don't know. I never felt comfortable going to school. My grades were never good because of this.</p><p>I did however manage to make some friends eventually along the way. I had what I thought was a girlfriend when I was in grade 4. I bought her jewelry with my pocket money and wrote love letters. It lasted a little while, until she dumped me via a letter saying that I wasn't writing her enough. LOL. I experienced my first heartbreak. Friends were lost and the bullying started again. Later school years, I was pushed down stairs and hit by kids bigger and smaller than myself. There were a few good times though. I made the rugby team and played a competition. It boosted my confidence, but it was short lived due to an accident during training where I had to have stiches done to my eye. I was also part of the chess team (dorky, maybe, but I enjoyed it). I played a competition for chess too. These moments were memorable and fun, because I was being involved.</p><p>Then high school started, brilliant. I could start as a new person. Yippee!! And then life said FUCK YOU! First year at high school was like my first year of grade school. All alone and I couldn't wait for the days to end. I made a few friends eventually, but I don't know if I could call them true friends. At the time, I was just happy that I had people to talk to.</p><p>You wouldn't believe it, but the bullying started again. I was humiliated and slapped around, while my so-called friends just stood around and watched. But I never wasted one single fucking tear and I never hit back. Looking back, if I had to relive that situation, I probably would have killed the guy. But what is done, is done. I used to walk home instead of taking the bus home, which was a 6km walk that took about an hour, because the bully would wait for me at the bus stop. </p><p>My neighborhood was quiet and I made a few friends. Had loads of fun cycling everywhere, exploring the bushes and kids just being kids. I don't know what it is about me that attracts people who want bully me. I marked several roads as danger zones, because I knew guys that would bully me if they saw me. I was on my guard absolutely everywhere I went, watching my back every second.</p><p>My childhood was clouded so much by the bad times that the good times are hard to remember. Though the best memories were with my best friend, we saw each other every single day and we did everything together. I remember cycling with him in the bushes all the way to the beach which was about 20km away and on the way back, we cycled on the road and had punctures in all tires. We didn't have cellphones in those days, so we found his friends place where we phoned his folks to come fetch us. Best day ever. I also remember staying over at his place, we sat on the roof outside his room and we spoke the entire night of our ideas to start up a company together and talking about life and girls of course. I had a crush on a girl, he knew about her, but I never had the confidence to do anything about it. She was also way out of my league.</p>
                    <b><u>The Big Move:</u></b><br>
                    <p>When I heard that my folks were thinking of moving to Belgium, I was ready. My mother and sister weren't happy, because they would be leaving a lot of friends and family behind, I didn't have that kind of connection. I was really happy, because I could start from scratch.</p><p>In South Africa, I only had to do another one and a half years of high school and I would be finished with school, but when we reached Belgium and it was time to enroll in school, we found out that I had to do three more years and just walking on to the school grounds and seeing all the people, ALL my nightmares came back. So when somebody came up with the idea of home-schooling, I was all for it. I begged for it. The problem with home-schooling is that I didn't have any interaction with other people. I was used to being alone, so this didn't bother me much.</p><p>In South Africa, we had dial-up internet, which was extremely slow and very expensive which meant that I could never use it. But in Belgium, it was faster and my father's work paid for it. This opened up a whole new world for me. I was on it day and night and I learnt so much. I learnt computer languages, programs and I started playing around with making websites and finding ways to make money online. It was great. I even made a few friends, one of which lived just around the corner from where I lived. We chatted for hours, and when I got a cellphone we had long conversations via sms. That was the easy part, but getting to actually meeting in person, mmm... That part was more difficult. We did eventually meet in person, and I was a mumbling mess. I had a crush on her and she knew it, but I took too long to gain the confidence to do anything about it. That caused us to slowly drift apart. That was another sad moment to add to my life.</p><p>With the help of my sister, I got a job working in a brasserie close to where I used to live. I had an income for the first time in my life. This was great, but it had an impact on my studies. My sister got me out of the house too. I went partying with her and her friends and I found a girlfriend. She was South African and she lived almost 30km away. But that didn't stop me from seeing her. Come rain or shine, I cycled to her place almost every day. I sometimes took the train and once I even walked all the way, because I missed the train. My folks would every now and again drop me off and pick me up. One time, I didn't have a lift & it was too late to take the train and I couldn't stay over at her place, so I just roamed the streets the entire night in the pouring rain. Yes, it was cold and no I didn't care. In the morning when she woke up, I was there. I did a lot to please her and make her happy, though I didn't see much in return. I was devastated when she broke up with me. I saw her later with another guy, and it made my blood boil. 'What did I do wrong?' Was the question that plagued my mind for weeks on end. </p><p>The guys at work helped me get through that, telling me that it wasn't worth it. I made a friend with a girl who later became my fianc√®, but I will get to that part.</p>
                    <b><u>Moving out:</u></b><br>
                    <p>I spent many nights after work, talking with my new friend. I was comfortable speaking with her and we had fun together. One night we went out to a party, and I had a few drinks behind me which gave me some confidence. I kissed her and it changed my life. She was moving out of her folks place and I helped her move. We spent many days together until one day she gave me a key to her place and I moved in. We were happy together and did everything together. We never argued and life was amazing. We went for a vacation to Greece, just the 2 of us. We had our first argument and we resolved it, though it wasn't the last. We eventually moved into a bigger place, but she wasn't happy with it. After a year we ended up moving into my folks place until we found another place. This made her even unhappier, but we finally found a house that was just perfect for us.</p><p>We were both happy, we had everything we needed and life couldn't get better, but then she said that she was pregnant. I was ecstatic. I was going to be a father. We had a baby girl (Phoebe). Life got interesting after that. Becoming a first time parent, it is somewhat daunting and in some ways very scary. I had 2 younger sisters growing up, so I had a bit more confidence with handling little ones, where she did not. So I ended up showing her how to look after our first born. I showed her how to bathe Phoebe, later I showed her how to feed Phoebe puree food. Two years after we had Phoebe, we had our second child, Caitlin. We just got used to having one when we added another. I think this is when life started to change for the worse. Arguments arose due to the fact that I couldn't help every day, because I had to bring the money in to support our growing family. But I helped everywhere I could. She was a stay at home mom to look after the kids and we would share the responsibilities of looking after the house, with her doing a bit more in the house when I was at work. Once the children were both in school we would look for a way that she could go back to work. This was a discussion that was agreed upon when we knew that she was pregnant with Phoebe. It didn't take long until it became too much for her and she started neglecting her tasks and I had to pull the weight. This added stress to our relationship. </p><p>Due to an issue with the toilet, there was dampness in the kid's room, and we had to move again. We couldn't find anything in our price range that was close to Phoebe's school, so we ended up moving pretty far away in a rather rural area. Phoebe changed schools, so that she was closer to home, but it didn't last long because she was being bullied at school. We changed her back to her original school where she was happier. </p><p>Our relationship didn't get any better. She got more depressed, being so far from everything. I tried everything to make her happy, but nothing I did helped. We went for counselling, but it didn't help either. We had an argument one night. The next day I was at work when I received an sms from her saying that nobody was going to be at home when I got home. That was the worst 10 hours of work. Every thought was going through my head the entire day. My entire world fell apart with one sms. When I got home, my children were gone and so was she. I took the rest of the week off work to get things back in order, but let me tell you, a week was not enough. She came by to explain that she wasn't happy and she couldn't be happy if I was in her life. I tried to show her how much that I had tried to make her happy, but she had blinders on and she had already made up her mind. Afterwards it was working out who gets what and when I get to see my children. It was going to be an agreement between us that was going to be signed by a notaris, but it wasn't that easy and lawyers had to get involved. The court case lasted a bit more than a year.</p><p>I learnt very quickly that I could no longer trust anybody. She not only crushed my heart, but she thought she could take my children away from me. HELL no!! She already took the car, scooter, all the furniture, my laptop and pretty much everything else. I was left with my computer, a little sofa, tv and game consoles. I couldn't move anywhere, other than my folks place, because I didn't have the money to start over. The court case was very trying. She sent the police to my house accusing me of stealing something that was mine, very amusing. She didn't expect that I kept the receipts. There was a lot of backstabbing and the friends I thought I had, ALL disappeared. Nice, my life was a complete fucking mess. (Just thinking about it now and typing this, brings tears to my eyes) </p><p>To help my case, I changed jobs, so that I had more time to be able to look after my children. This ended up not helping much at all. Once the court case was over, I didn't get what I wanted. Instead, I got half the time I expected to spend with my children and I had to pay 300‚Ç¨ every month to my ex. During the court case, my ex restarted her life. She got a job, she moved into a very cheap house. After the court case, she not only had that, but she got the 300‚Ç¨ from me and she got the child allowance from the government, while I was stuck in a dead end job as a postman with minimal wage and still living with my folks and paying board. I think I got the shit end of the stick.</p><p>Two years after the court case, I decided to make some changes to my life. I changed jobs, I started accumulating furniture and making plans to move into a place of my own. I was so excited by the thought of starting over, that I didn't take into consideration the cost of living alone. FUCK ME! This is where I am now. I am happy to be living alone, but it has a cost. It's lonely and my miscalculating the cost of living is putting me deeper and deeper in debt. Everything that has happened in my life has brought me to this point.</p>
					<b><u>To summarize:</u></b>
                    <p>My childhood and school years were an absolute nightmare, being bullied the majority of the time. My folks knew something was going on, but they didn't know what, because I kept everything inside. My grades were bad because my mind was finding ways to avoid being bullied at school which resulted in very little success in finding a job that I wanted. I have just been grabbing at any opportunity I can get my hands on.</p><p>All my relationships have ended up being one sided, where I have been doing the heavy lifting and have ended with heart break. I've had a few friends that ended up not being friends except for one.</p><p>I can honestly say that I have had my fair share of shit in my life. During the break up with my ex, I was pushed to a point that I didn't want to live anymore. That was the deepest point in my life, where my feelings got the better of me and I took a few too many pills to take away the pain I was going through. Which surprise, surprise didn't help. I just felt like crap for a few days, luckily. While I was feeling like crap, I was thinking to myself, 'Is it worth it?' The answer was a clear, NO. Yes, it hurt, that someone that was so close just changed overnight, took everything away and turned my life upside down, but I could do better without those kinds of people in my life. I learnt from my mistakes and I never touch pills that are not prescribed from a doctor.</p>
					<b><u>What changed:</u></b>
                    <p>The beginning of 2014, I made a promise to myself that I would start thinking positively no matter what. This promise was not easy to keep, but I have done my best and the results were not what I expected. </p><p>My life so far has been filled with negativity and it has clouded my thinking and has brought on more negativity. Once I started thinking positively, all the good memories started coming back. I remember my very first kiss. I remember my first crush and how she made me feel when she walked by or spoke to me. I remember getting my first very own bicycle and how excited I was. I remember getting an award for a painting I made in school and how proud I was that it was going to be in a gallery in Taiwan. I remember my first house party I went to and dancing with a girl I had a crush on. I remember buying my first car and how I would ride everywhere with it because I could. I would get lost a lot, but it was loads of fun. It was loads of fun to explore new territory. </p><p>Even the bad times in life have had their positive sides. Although the biggest part of my life ended with great pain and heartbreak, I have two miracles that came from it, Phoebe and Caitlin. For that, I am very grateful. I have a better connection with my folks, which were always there when I needed them most. Thank you. I found out who my true friends were, which was an eye opener. The bullying was a bit trickier to find a positive for, but it then hit me. I learnt a lot from those assholes. I learnt that when you are hit to the floor, you just get right back up every single time and show them that they are not going to get you down. I learnt resilience. </p>
                    <b><u>My last thoughts:</u></b>
                    <p>After my big breakup, I wanted to find somebody to fill the big hole that I was missing. I have been on dating sites and the first months I went out a lot searching for that one person that could bring back that happiness I had. I did all that with zero results. This got me down for several days until I made my promise. This is when life changed for me (I wish I could tell you a happy ending, but it is in the process).  Because of me thinking positively, it hit me that I can't expect to find happiness yet. I have to work on myself before I can open myself up to that kind of commitment. This is now my challenge. I need to make a better me. I have to define what happiness is to me. I have to be able to look in the mirror, smile and believe in myself and be able to make myself happy again. Once I have been able to do that, only then will I be ready to find happiness in somebody else.</p>
                    <b><u>My challenge for you:</u></b>
                    <p>If you are depressed or feeling unhappy about how life has treated you, I am challenging you, to look in the mirror and to find your own happiness from within and no matter what, ALWAYS think positively. When you are feeling sad, just smile, it might be hard, but it does a lot. I am not saying that doing this will fix all your problems. I am giving you a tool that you can use to help you find a solution. </p>
