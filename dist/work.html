                <img src="img/capabilities/html5.png" alt="HTML5">
                <p>I started learning HTML when I was 16 years old. I had a personal website for family and friends with domain (www.kixster.be), but it has been retired.</p>

                <p>Furthering my knowledge for createing webpages, I started to learn CSS. With this knowledge, I helped friends create pages.</p>

            <div class="item">
                <img src="img/capabilities/js.png" alt="Project 3">
                <p>To make more responsive and interactive webpages, I started to learn Javascript. I am still furthering my knowledge with Vue.Js, Node.js and other frameworks.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <img src="img/capabilities/php.png" alt="PHP">
                <p>Data manipulation was my next challenge. So I first turned to PHP, to further grow my knowledge.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <img src="img/capabilities/sql.png" alt="DB">
                <p>Ofcourse, I would need a database to store my data. So I learnt how to work with mySQL, Access and mondoDB.</p>

            <div class="item">
                <img src="img/capabilities/python.jpg" alt="Python">

                <img src="img/capabilities/windows.png" alt="Windows">
                <p>I have worked with Windows since Windows 3 was born. Working my way through almost all the versions. 3, 95, 98, 2000, ME, Vista, 7, 8 and now 10.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <img src="img/capabilities/linux.png" alt="Linux">
                <p>There were and still are times where Windows is flawed and I have turned to Linux. Mandrake, Mandriva, Ubuntu, SUSE, Knoppix, Kali, RaspBian and now Mint.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <img src="img/capabilities/hardware.png" alt="Hardware">
                <p>Working with computers has always been a great interest of mine since the days of the XT 286 pc. Hardware doesn't scare me. Take it apart, install it and troubleshooting it is all fun in my books.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <img src="img/capabilities/network.svg" alt="Networks">
                <p>Working with servers, webpages and operating systems, a good knowledge of how data moves through the cables and air is a must. For this, I have a good understanding of the inner workings.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <img src="img/capabilities/ethical_hacking.png" alt="Ethical-Hacking">
                <p>Security and protection of data is a must in this day and age. To better secure my networks and to stay ahead of the hackers, I learnt ethical hacking.</p>

            <div class="item">
                <img src="img/capabilities/cpp.png" alt="C++">
                <p>I think that the very first programming language that I learnt was Basic. But the language that really started me with programming was C++. This helped me greatly when learning other languages as the principles are basically the same in all languages, just a different syntax and/or mindset.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <img src="img/capabilities/excel.PNG" alt="Excel-Macros">
                <p>At the moment all the previously mentioned knowledge is being used as a hobby. The only application that I can use for work purposes is Excel. I find ways to use macros to be more work efficient and to solve problems that our work authorized applications can't. In some cases, I have created full applications in Excel using the VB editor of Excel.</p>
